The framework of the proposed MSFR-GCN for EEG
emotion recognition is shown in Fig. 2. In MSFR-GCN, the
feature-adaptive branch is used to learn dynamic brain connections. The MSFR branch examines the impact of assigning
varying weights to channels, frequency bands, and samples on
emotion detection and concatenates the scaled EEG features to
produce the final node features (V). And those two branches
provide graph input to GCN, and after two layers, we sum the
graph via feature-pool to create the final EEG graph representation in MSFR-GCN. The final EEG graph representation is
then connected to a fully connected layer, and the predicted
labels are obtained through a softmax layer
